💧 Water Quality Prediction – AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025)
📅 Internship Period: June 16 – July 16, 2025
🧑‍🏫 Trainer: Raghunandan M S (Edunet Foundation – Skills4Future)
🏢 Organized by: AICTE & Shell
🔬 Theme: Environmental Analytics using Machine Learning

🧪 Project Overview
As part of the AICTE Virtual Internship, I worked on a real-world project focused on predicting water quality parameters using machine learning techniques. This project aimed to assist in evaluating water potability and improving environmental decision-making through data-driven methods.

🎯 Project Goal
To build and evaluate a MultiOutput Regression Model that predicts multiple water quality indicators — such as pH, hardness, solids, and turbidity — based on given attributes, and ultimately assess potability.
