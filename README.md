# 💧 Water Quality Prediction – AICTE Virtual Internship (June 2025)

📅 **Internship Period:** June 16 – July 16, 2025  
🧑‍🏫 **Trainer:** Raghunandan M S (Edunet Foundation – Skills4Future)  
🏢 **Organized by:** AICTE & Shell  
🔬 **Theme:** Environmental Analytics using Machine Learning

---

## 🧪 Project Overview

As part of the AICTE Virtual Internship, I worked on a real-world project focused on **predicting water quality parameters** using machine learning techniques. This project aimed to assist in evaluating **water potability** and improving **environmental decision-making** through data-driven methods.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build and evaluate a **MultiOutput Regression Model** that predicts multiple water quality indicators — such as **pH**, **hardness**, **solids**, and **turbidity** — based on given attributes, and ultimately assess **potability**.
